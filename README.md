# Kitty's terminal graphics protocol -- client-side OCaml implementation

![demo screenshot](demo.png)

See [https://sw.kovidgoyal.net/kitty/graphics-protocol/](https://sw.kovidgoyal.net/kitty/graphics-protocol/).

This is WIP but should be enough for basic tasks. Support for "advanced" uses of
the protocols (using images/pattern ids) probably needs more work. Contributions
welcome!
